If everything has gone to plan, you should now have a fully automated energy system! Hopefully this guide has been
helpful to you. For some this may be the end of the road, but for many it is just the beginning! Once you are up and
running, there are a few more things you may want to start looking into:

1. Using [Amber2MQTT](https://github.com/cabberley/amber2mqtt-addon) for faster, more accurate price updates
2. Adding [ML-based load forecasting](https://emhass.readthedocs.io/en/latest/mlforecaster.html)
3. Adding [deferrable loads](https://github.com/AnnableLab/emhass-guide/discussions/12)
