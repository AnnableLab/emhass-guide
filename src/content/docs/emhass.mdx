title: Running EMHASS
description: Create scripts and automations to run EMHASS and generate your energy optimization plan.

import { Tabs, TabItem } from "@astrojs/starlight/components";
import CodeBlock from "../../components/CodeBlock.astro";
import { applyPatch } from "diff";
import emhassAmberScriptYaml from "../../includes/emhass_script.yaml?raw";
import emhassA2MScriptPatchYaml from "../../includes/emhass_script.patch?raw";
import emhassAmberAutomationYaml from "../../includes/emhass_automation.yaml?raw";
import emhassA2MAutomationPatchYaml from "../../includes/emhass_automation.patch?raw";

export const emhassA2MScriptYaml = applyPatch(emhassAmberScriptYaml, emhassA2MScriptPatchYaml) || emhassAutomationYaml;
export const emhassA2MAutomationYaml =
  applyPatch(emhassAmberAutomationYaml, emhassA2MAutomationPatchYaml) || emhassA2MScriptPatchYaml;

To run EMHASS, we want to execute the rest commands we setup earlier with all the parameters they need. In this guide we
will use scripts.

You will also need to manually enable these disabled Sigenergy Plant sensors in order for the script to function:

- `sensor.sigen_plant_rated_energy_capacity`
- `sensor.sigen_plant_ess_rated_charging_power`
- `sensor.sigen_plant_ess_rated_discharging_power`
- `sensor.sigen_plant_max_active_power`

Solcast by default only enables today and tomorrow solar forecast sensors, meaning at 11pm you'll only get 25 hours of
forecasting. You will need to enable the solcast day 3 forecast sensor to always provide 2 full days of solar
forecasting (and if you want longer horizons, you can enable up to 7 days and add them to the forecasts list within the
script).

- `sensor.solcast_pv_forecast_forecast_day_3`

Next, create a new script from scratch (under Settings → Automations & Scenes → Scripts), switch to YAML mode and add
the content below.

The critical variables to configure are at the very top.

1. `costfun` — this can be either `profit`, `cost` or `self-consumption`, which either maximize profit, minimize cost or
   maximize self-consumption (selling any excess).
2. `maximum_power_from_grid` — this is the maximum power you can draw from the grid (e.g. when charging your batteries
   from the grid).
3. `maximum_power_to_grid` — this is the maximum power you can feed into the grid (e.g. when exporting solar, or
   discharging batteries).
4. `battery_minimum_percent` — what percentage (0-100) of your battery you always want to keep as a minimum (e.g. for
   blackout protection).

<Tabs syncKey="amber">
  <TabItem label="Amber Integration">
    <CodeBlock lang="yaml" code={emhassAmberScriptYaml} />
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem label="Amber2MQTT">
    <CodeBlock lang="yaml" code={emhassA2MScriptYaml} />
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

If you run this script, EMHASS will produce a plan for the day. You should be able to manually run the script and check
the output in the EMHASS webview. We will also be adding our own output dashboard shortly.

You'll want to be running this script regularly as forecasts change throughout the day, so the next step is to setup a
new automation:

<Tabs syncKey="amber">
  <TabItem label="Amber Integration">
    <CodeBlock lang="yaml" code={emhassAmberAutomationYaml} />
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem label="Amber2MQTT">
    <CodeBlock lang="yaml" code={emhassA2MAutomationYaml} />
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

This will run every time the prices change.

Note: On my Intel NUC Home Assistant server, this script takes a couple of seconds to run. If you are running lower-end
hardware, you may want to either increase the optimization time step or reduce the running frequency.
